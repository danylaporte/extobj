/// A type-erased, owned value.
///
/// `DynObj` behaves like a `Box<dyn Any>` but is implemented entirely with
/// raw pointers to avoid storing a v-table, making it more lightweight.
/// The concrete type is known only at construction time (via `new`) and must
/// be re-supplied by the caller when accessing the value (via `get`,
/// `get_mut`, or `into_inner`).
///
/// # Safety
///
/// * The object must **always** be dropped with the same type `T` that was
///   used to create it to prevent undefined behavior.
/// * Accessing the value with the wrong type (e.g., `get::<U>` when the object was
///   created with `new::<T>`) results in **instant undefined behavior**.
/// * In `debug_assertions` builds, the actual `TypeId` is stored, and an
///   assertion will catch mismatched types, but this safety check is **not present**
///   in release builds to optimize performance.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// let mut obj = extobj::DynObj::new(String::from("hello"));
/// let s: &mut String = unsafe { obj.get_mut() };
/// s.push_str(" world");
/// let s: String = unsafe { obj.into_inner() };
/// assert_eq!(s, "hello world");
